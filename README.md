# Urban_Farm-4.0
Projects to inject Digital Twin analysis into Farming

## [Bees] Guardian at the Gate  
Initial step complete - Deep Learning used with Artificial Neural Network for the inspection of a visual image for varroa mite infestation.  Binary State (Bee / varroa) [93% accuracy, 10/6/24].  
 
Next Step - Multi-category Identification (Bee, varroa, cooling, Wasp)  
 
Future state -
- X/Y coordinate
- Individual bee identification
- Incoming trajectory tracking
- Maximum ZOT
- Minimum ZOT
- Air Popper design (field maintenance)


## [Bees] Heat Matters  
Initial Step - Fact Finding.
- Observation Hive
- Observation Hive - "Shattered" design and maximum offset length (→ Holland)
- Cell Placement
- Cell Routing safety
- EM limits
- Placement application for displaced thermal differential

## [Fish] Fish Food  
Initial step complete - Logistic Regression model constructed to determine weight ƒ(Length)
- This is for proof of concept.
- See Weight Tank.

## [Fish] Fish-al Recognition  
Initial Step - Hardware Set up [Open CV] (Project - Post 10/21/24)
Next Step - Initial meeting with supervisor complete (RN - 11/08/24)  
Future state -
- 2nd Supervisor ??? (DC)
- Calcein (Amazon)
- Contact Hatchery
- Data acquisition loop ("Home" cell)
- buy goldfish

## [Fish] Weight Tank  
Initial step complete - Half-shell Tank designed (PTC Creo)
Next Step - Design list
Future state -
- Complete Density Check
- Complete Supervisor Check
- Complete Window Check
- Verify load strain mitigation (controlled loop)
- Construct
- Build incident alarm (or shift to limited feedings)
